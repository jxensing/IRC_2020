Example of the Instrument Response Correction and the XML file used in my PhD thesis: Multi-Component Ambient Seismic Noise Tomography of the Auckland Volcanic Field.

This example includes three traces, the vertical component data for ABAZ (a short period surface station), AWAZ (a short beriod borehole seismometer), and HIZ (a broad band surface station).
However, the XML file contains the instrument response information used for all the seismometers in the network we used.
